# Stacks (stacks.ai) — What it does and what it stands for

## One‑paragraph summary
Stacks is an AI-native platform for accounting and finance teams that helps manage and automate the month‑end close. It combines close management (workflows, ownership, approvals, and audit trail) with automation across reconciliations, journal entries, and analysis/reporting—plus “agentic AI” capabilities designed to operate inside accounting controls and evidence requirements.

---

## The problem Stacks is solving
Month‑end close is still dominated by fragmentation and manual work:
- Core work is spread across ERPs, spreadsheets, shared folders, emails, and Slack threads.
- Traditional “close tools” often behave like passive checklists: they track what needs doing but don’t help complete the underlying accounting work.
- Audit readiness frequently becomes a last‑minute scramble because evidence and context are scattered instead of embedded in day‑to‑day workflows.

---

## Who it’s for
Stacks is built for accounting teams (preparers, IC accountants, controllers, and finance leaders/CFOs) and positions itself for mid‑to‑large organisations that want faster closes without compromising controls, evidence, and accuracy.

## What Stacks does (product surface area)

### 1) Close management (“Workspace”)
A close “control tower” that:
- Turns tasks into workflows (not just reminders).
- Centralises ownership (preparer/reviewer), approvals, documentation, and timestamped actions.
- Provides visibility into progress and bottlenecks, plus notifications (email/Slack) when items change or are blocked.

### 2) Account reconciliations
Reconciliation tooling intended to reduce spreadsheet-heavy work by:
- Pulling and syncing data directly from source systems (ERP and other feeds).
- Supporting file reading/import for faster reconciliation.
- Applying automation to transaction matching and improving matching over time based on confirmed manual matches (learning month‑on‑month).

### 3) Journal entries (Excel-first workflow)
An “Excel assistant/copilot” approach:
- Keeps accountants in Excel while connecting sheets to the ERP (bi-directional sync / “synced sheets”).
- Helps create, validate, and post journal entries with fewer manual steps and more structured evidence.

### 4) Analysis & reporting (incl. variance/flux workflows)
Stacks positions reporting as part of the close workflow:
- Turns close data into answers (trends/variances).
- Supports flux/variance narratives by surfacing what changed and drafting explanations that a human can verify.

### 5) Accounting agents (“Agentic AI for Finance”)
A suite of AI agents designed for enterprise accounting constraints, with examples that include:
- Reconciliations: automate routine matching; humans review exceptions.
- Journals: pre-categorise, route for review, and post with audit evidence.
- Anomalies: flag discrepancies earlier with explanations.
- Reporting: surface insights to help teams act faster.

## How it works (the underlying principles)

### Native data integration (ERP-connected, real-time)
Stacks emphasises “native” ERP integrations (e.g., NetSuite, Microsoft Dynamics, Xero) so tasks run on live balances and transactions. If data changes, workflows can reopen and notify the right people—reducing version-control chaos.

### Audit-ready by default
Stacks frames audit readiness as an *everyday workflow outcome* rather than a quarter‑end scramble:
- Consistent, repeatable processes
- Clear ownership and review history
- Evidence attached “in context”
- Traceable, timestamped audit trail
- Controls (permissions, approvals) aligned to how the team works

### Meet teams where they work (Excel + Slack + email)
Rather than forcing accountants into a brand-new interface, Stacks explicitly builds around existing tools:
- Excel remains central for many preparer workflows.
- Slack and email are used for progress updates, nudges, and closing coordination.

### Trust as a product requirement
Stacks repeatedly ties adoption and time-to-value to *trust*:
- Automation must be transparent and reviewable.
- Evidence and controls must be built-in.
- Security is treated as foundational, not optional.

## What Stacks stands for (themes you’ll see across their messaging)

### “Finance is strategic; the close should enable it”
Stacks positions finance as a driver of strategy and innovation—not just bookkeeping—and argues automation should free teams to do higher‑impact work (insight, decision support, coaching, forecasting).

### “Time saved” as a product philosophy
Stacks describes “time saved” as a core metric and decision lens: not shaving seconds, but reclaiming hours for higher-leverage work.

### “Don’t replace Excel; superpower it”
A consistent stance is that Excel isn’t going away in accounting. Stacks aims to integrate with it deeply (ERP-connected, agent-ready), while adding structure, speed, and control.

### “Controls, evidence, accuracy—without the chaos”
A recurring point: most AI tools ignore accounting fundamentals. Stacks’ pitch is “radical productivity gains” *inside* controls and evidence requirements, not around them.

### “Security is the product”
Stacks positions security and compliance as part of the product itself, and publicly references major milestones (ISO 27001:2022, GDPR, SOC 2 Type II).

## Proof points (as described on Stacks’ site)
- Customer quote referencing reduction in time to close by “three and a half days” (example: CFO testimonial on Stacks’ site).
- Case study claims for reconciliation automation (example: automating a very high percentage of bank-statement matches at a customer).

(Interpret these as Stacks’ own stated outcomes and customer quotes; validate numbers with the specific case study when needed.)

## Glossary (quick definitions)
- **Month-end close:** The recurring process of finalising financial records for the month (reconciliations, journal entries, approvals, reporting).
- **Reconciliation:** Matching balances/transactions across sources (e.g., ERP GL vs bank statement) and resolving exceptions.
- **Journal entry:** Posting adjustments or accruals to the ledger, typically requiring review/approval and evidence.
- **Flux / variance analysis:** Explaining why a balance or P&L line changed versus last period or budget.
- **Audit trail:** A record of who did what, when, with what evidence, and why.
